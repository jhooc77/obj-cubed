# obj^3 (objcubed)

A [BlockBench](https://www.blockbench.net/) plugin for exporting arbitrary 3D models into Minecraft resource packs using custom core shaders.

Forked from [Godlander's objmc](https://github.com/Godlander/objmc) — the original Python-based tool that pioneered the technique of encoding OBJ mesh data into textures and decoding it in vanilla Minecraft shaders.

**obj^3** replaces the Python script + CLI workflow with a single BlockBench plugin.

## How it works

Model geometry (vertex positions, UVs, face indices) is encoded into a specially formatted PNG texture. A set of core shaders included in the resource pack reads this texture at render time, reconstructing the 3D mesh from the pixel data. The vanilla Minecraft renderer displays the result — no mods required.

## Surface-v4-only performance branch

This branch intentionally ships one subgroup-free static backend. Static OBJ
items, item displays, blocks, display transforms (including independent Z scale
and both rotations), textures/atlases, texture animation, tinting, and emissive
faces remain available. Non-planar/concave/non-affine quads and N-gons are
triangulated automatically during export.

Geometry animation, worn equipment/armor, RGB geometry scale, and RGB geometry-
time control are rejected with a clear export error; there is no legacy/full-v2
fallback. The runtime shaders are GLSL 4.10 and contain no subgroup extension or
`subgroupQuadBroadcast` call.

The renderer uses three static fast paths: exact rectangular faces can bypass
the custom decoder entirely, other rectangles skip fragment clipping, and
remaining triangles/convex quads use precomputed affine UV and edge equations.
Only the two possible provoking vertices fetch per-face metadata.

## Features

- **Direct BlockBench export** — File > Export as obj^3
- **Body-part tagging** — right-click a group to assign it a body part; tags persist in the `.bbmodel`
- **Emissive faces** — right-click a cube/mesh to make it fullbright
- **Animated textures** — a frame-strip texture plays in game (hand, GUI, world, armor), with per-frame tick rate and optional cross-fade; works standalone or inside an atlas
- **Multi-texture atlas** — combine multiple textures into one atlas automatically (one animated strip per atlas keeps animating)
- **Vanilla-exact display** — every display slot (right/left hand in first and third person, head, GUI, ground, item frame, shelf) has its own tab with rotation/translation/scale, and a model lands exactly where the same vanilla model would — rotations included
- **Presets** — multiple named export configurations saved per project
- **Localized UI** — English and Russian, with an in-dialog guided tour of every control
- **Custom PNG encoder** — bypasses browser alpha premultiplication to preserve exact RGB values

## Requirements

- BlockBench 4.8.0+ (desktop variant — the custom PNG encoder needs Node.js)
- Minecraft 26.1.2 – 26.2 — the bundled core shaders support both (26.2's reversed
  depth buffer and relocated entity geometry are detected and handled in-shader)

Core shaders are a vanilla resource-pack feature, but they are version-sensitive: the
shaders are tuned for 26.1.2–26.2 and may need updating for other versions. Modded
compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Installation

1. Download `objcubed.js`
2. In BlockBench: File > Plugins > Load Plugin from File > select `objcubed.js`
3. Copy the `objcubed/` resource pack folder to your Minecraft `resourcepacks/` directory

## Modeling conventions

- **Build on the grid floor.** The BlockBench grid floor (y=0) is the block bottom
  in game: a model standing on the grid stands on the block, exactly like a
  vanilla JSON model built from 0..16. A model floating above (or straddling)
  the grid will float the same way in game — in every display slot at once.
- **Horizontal origin = block centre.** Centre the model on the origin in X/Z.
- Export from the **Edit** tab (the plugin guards against the Display and
  Animate tabs baking their pose into a static export, but Edit is the
  canonical state).

## Usage

1. Open or create a model in BlockBench (Generic Model or any format with mesh/cube elements)
2. File > Export > **Export as obj^3...**
3. Configure settings in the export dialog:
   - **Texture** — select texture or enable atlas for multiple textures; a frame-strip texture reveals the animated-texture controls
   - **Transform** — scale and offset the model
   - **Animation** — select animation, set FPS and time range
   - **Display** — rotation/translation/scale per display slot, one tab each (the third-person left hand mirrors the right until unticked)
   - **Advanced** — easing, interpolation, color behavior, autorotate
4. Click **Export** — saves a PNG (encoded model) and JSON (Minecraft model) to your chosen location

### Datapack generation

When animation is enabled, you can generate a datapack for controlling animation via commands:

- **play** — start autoplay loop synced to GameTime
- **stop** — freeze at current frame
- **set** — freeze at a specific frame (set score before calling)
- **play_from** — autoplay starting from frame N
- **play_once** — play one cycle then freeze at last frame (shader-driven, no tick function needed)

Target types: equipment entity, item_display, or player (via temporary armor stand).

Example:
```mcfunction
execute as @e[type=armor_stand] run function mypack:walk/play
```

## Armor / equipment export

Instead of a held item, a model can be rendered as **worn armor** via the entity
equipment layer. A single armor piece can span several body parts — a chestplate
covers the torso **and both arms** — and each part follows its own bone, so the
sleeves swing with the player's arms.

**Body parts:** `0` body, `1` head, `2`/`3` right/left arm, `4`/`5` right/left leg,
`6`/`7` right/left foot. Left limbs are automatically un-mirrored to match the way
Minecraft mirrors the left arm/leg.

**Workflow:**

1. **Group by body part.** Put each part's geometry in its own group (a `body`
   group, a `right_arm` group, etc.). Model the set anatomically — body in the
   torso, arms out to the sides.
2. **Tag each group** — right-click the group → **obj³: Body part** → pick the part.
   Tags are saved into the `.bbmodel` (so they survive save/reload).
3. **Set each group's pivot** (the orange origin point) at the point where the part
   attaches to the body — i.e. the vanilla bone position (shoulder, hip, …). The
   geometry is anchored relative to this pivot, so the part lands where you placed
   the pivot regardless of the model's size or layout.
4. In the export dialog enable **Export as Equipment (armor)** and tick the
   **Armor pieces** to export. Each writes its own equipment asset spanning its parts:

   | Piece | Body parts | Equipment layer |
   |-------|------------|-----------------|
   | Helmet | head | `humanoid` |
   | Chestplate | body + both arms | `humanoid` |
   | Leggings | both legs | `humanoid_leggings` |
   | Boots | both feet | `humanoid` |

5. **Export.** obj³ writes, per checked piece, an equipment definition
   (`assets/minecraft/equipment/<name>_<piece>.json`), one layer texture per model
   face, and a `<name>_<piece>_give.txt` containing the command to equip it, e.g.:

   ```mcfunction
   give @s minecraft:leather_chestplate[minecraft:equippable={slot:"chest",asset_id:"minecraft:<name>_chestplate"}]
   ```

   (`<name>` is the **Custom model data name** field from the export dialog — it names
   all output assets, so several models coexist without overwriting each other.)

Faces that belong to no tagged part are skipped, so untagged geometry will not
appear. (The old single-slot export — the whole model anchored to one body
part — still runs when no pieces are checked, for old projects; its UI is
retired in favour of the piece checkboxes.)

## Right-click tools

obj³ adds two entries to the Outliner right-click menu:

- **obj³: Body part** (on a group) — assign the group to a body part for armor
  export (see above). Saved in the project.
- **Emissive toggle** (on a cube/mesh) — mark faces as fullbright so they ignore
  world lighting (glowing trims, eyes, runes). Saved in the project.

## Resource pack structure

Export is one-shot: pick the resource pack root once and the plugin writes
everything below it with no further dialogs. Re-exporting overwrites cleanly;
a second model on the same base item coexists via custom_model_data.

```
<resource pack root>/
  pack.mcmeta
  assets/objcubed/
    textures/item/<name>.png         — your exported PNG texture
    models/item/<name>_<slot>.json   — per-slot JSON models (ref objcubed:item/<name>)
  assets/minecraft/
    items/<baseItem>.json            — item override (custom_model_data select)
    atlases/blocks.json              — stitches objcubed item textures into the atlas
    equipment/<name>_<piece>.json            — armor definitions (equipment export only)
    textures/entity/equipment/<layer>/...    — per-face armor layer textures
    shaders/
      core/
        terrain.vsh / terrain.fsh    — placed blocks
        block.vsh / block.fsh        — falling blocks, pistons
        entity.vsh / entity.fsh      — entities, armor
        item.vsh / item.fsh          — items in hand + GUI
      include/
        objmc_main.glsl              — core model decoding
        objmc_tools.glsl             — vertex math utilities
        objmc_light.glsl             — lightmap sampling
```

## Shader pipelines

| Pipeline | Shader | Use case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Terrain | `core/terrain` | Chunk blocks (placed in world) |
| Block | `core/block` | Falling blocks, pistons |
| Entity | `core/entity` | Entities, armor stands, armor |
| Item | `core/item` | Items in hand and GUI |

## Performance

objmc models add minimal overhead — mostly extra texture fetches. Performance scales linearly with face count. A 20K-face block model performs similarly to rendering ~3300 regular blocks without culling. Block models are significantly more performant than entity models.

High face counts (50K+) in a single chunk section can hit the UberGpuBuffer 2MB limit and crash the game. Use blockstate overrides to redirect high-poly block models if needed.

## Controlling models via color

Items with overlay color (potions, dyed leather armor) can pass data to the shader through RGB bytes. The `colorbehavior` setting defines what each byte controls:

- `direct` — passes the channel value directly as model color (tint). With all three channels set to direct, `custom_color` is used as an RGB tint multiplied with the texture. White (`0xFFFFFF`) preserves the original texture; other values tint it.
- `time` — animation time offset
- `scale` — model scale
- `overlay` — overlay color hue (converts value to HSV palette color)
- `hurt` — hurt flash (red tint)

Default is `direct/direct/direct`.

Example — tint a model red:
```mcfunction
give @s minecraft:potion[potion_contents={custom_color:16711680}]
```

When `colorbehavior = time/time/time` (set automatically when generating a datapack), the shader uses `potion_contents.custom_color` as a 24-bit animation control value. Values below 8388608 are autoplay offsets; values above are manual frame indices.

## Limitations (by design or not yet supported)

- **Animated strips per atlas are texture-width-bound**: each strip costs two
  header pixels, so a 16px-wide texture fits ~5 strips, 32px ~11, 64px+ the
  hard cap of 15. Overflowing strips are exported static, with a warning that
  says how many fit. All strips share one tick rate.
- **Ground / shelf Y translation** is clamped by Minecraft itself; obj³
  compensates the base height internally, but a custom Y translation on these
  slots will not move the model.
- **GUI icons don't animate** — Minecraft bakes inventory icons once per
  resource reload; obj³ pins them to frame 0 instead of a random frame.
- **Legacy armor PNGs (marker 254, pre-v0.5.31)** are no longer decoded —
  re-export old armor with the current plugin.
- **UV tiling** (coordinates outside 0..1) is clamped — keep the model UV-mapped
  inside the texture frame. In atlas mode this clamp is per-texture.

## Notes

- **Flipped UV** — BlockBench OBJ export sometimes flips UVs. Use the Flip UV option if the model looks wrong.
- **Alpha preservation** — The plugin uses a custom PNG encoder (Node.js zlib) instead of canvas to avoid alpha premultiplication corrupting RGB data.
- **Texture size** — Minimum 8px wide (16px+ if you use the GUI slot — the icon transform header needs the width). Wider textures are recommended for high vertex counts or animations.
- **Frame count** — More FPS and longer animations = larger texture. The shader interpolates between frames, so fewer keyframes are often sufficient.
